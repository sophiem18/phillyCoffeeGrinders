# ☕️ Philly Coffee Grinders ☕️

Hey everyone👋🏼! Here is my project that I built in Spring 2025 for Web Application Programming. 
Styling is minimal - as you can tell. However, we focused primarily on learning the fundamental skills needed to create a great web application - rather than focusing on the frontend look. 

## 🤓 What did I learn? 🤓
In this project, I learned:
<ul>
    <li>Spring Boot</li>
    <li>Principles of Web Design</li>
    <li>React </li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>Databases (mySQL)</li> 
</ul>

## 💪🏼 Why Philly Coffee Grinders? 💪🏼
I thought it would be cool to have a place for people that are WFH to rank their favorite coffee shops that they work/grind at (See what I did there!!😏) 
It is all for fun and just something I wanted to try out. 

If I were to expand on this project, I would definitely improve the front end, A LOT. Thanks for reading this! Take a look around the site.
